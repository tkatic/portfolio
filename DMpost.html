      <h3>COVID-19 Flight Data Research</h3>

      <p>
        This was a two-semester project with the Purdue Datamine and Sandia
        National Laboratories to investigate flight data before and during the
        COVID-19 pandemic.
        <br />
        <br />
        I was on a team of 3 within the sandia team that wanted to investigate
        whether the pandemic resulted in any changes to the flight trajectories
        and whether the lengths of flights in general, in terms of distance and
        time, had greatly changed.
        <br />
        <br />
        During the first semester, we spent most of our time researching and
        cleaning the large OpenSky data set that we were going to use for our
        analysis. The data was cleaned using R and we began to prepare the
        visualizations in Python.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the second semester, we worked to finalize our renderings and report
        our conclusions at the symposium held in the spring. The cleaned data
        was rendered in Python using Pandas and scripts for calculations were
        made using NumPy.
        <br />
        <br />
        All of the publicly-available findings from this project can be viewed
