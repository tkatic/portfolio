      <h3>Lands' End Performance Dashboard</h3>

      <p>
        This was the main project that I was assigned during my internship at
        Lands' End. I was tasked with making a dashboard that would interact
        with the PageSpeed Insights API and render the data according to
        filters.
        <br />
        <br />
        The project began with a CLI application in Node JS that sent an HTTP
        request to the PageSpeed Insights API based on a few parameters, such as
        url.
        <br />
        <br />
        I then built a REST API that automated the request and stored the data
        into MongoDB. The final part of the project was to build the webpage
        with an interactive dashboard and useful filters such as url, metric,
        and date.
        <br />
        <br />
        The best part of this project was that the tool was set to be used by
        roughly 500 internal employees. It felt amazing to develop something by
        myself that would be used and improve the efficiency of their analytics.
        <br />
        <br />
        I worked on this project for 3 months during the duration of my
        internship as a Web Engineer at Lands' End.
